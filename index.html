    <h6>My favourite place in the world is Ladakh which is situated in northern part of India.</h6>
    <p>Ladakh is most famous for breathtaking landscapes, the crystal clear skies,
        the highest mountain passes, thrilling adventure activities, Buddhist Monasteries
        and festivals. Ladakh gains a lot of popularity for being the only cold desert in
        India apart from bordering the Worldâ€™s highest saltwater Lake <b>Pangong Lake</b>.
        Riding up the highest motorable road in the world, <b>Khardung la</b> is a dream come
        true for many. The Hunder sand dunes, frozen river trek and snow leopards all find their
        only home in Ladakh.</p>

        <p>In graph theory, a cycle in a graph is a non-empty trail in which the only 
            repeated vertices are the first and last vertices. A directed cycle in a directed 
            graph is a non-empty directed trail in which the only repeated vertices are the first 
            and last vertices.
