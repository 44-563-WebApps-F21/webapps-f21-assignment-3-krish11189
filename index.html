        <h6>My favourite place in the world is Ladakh which is situated in northern part of India.</h6>
        <p>Ladakh is most famous for breathtaking landscapes, the crystal clear skies, 
        the highest mountain passes, thrilling adventure activities, Buddhist Monasteries 
        and festivals. Ladakh gains a lot of popularity for being the only cold desert in 
        India apart from bordering the Worldâ€™s highest saltwater Lake <b>Pangong Lake</b>. 
        Riding up the highest motorable road in the world, <b>Khardung la</b> is a dream come 
        true for many. The Hunder sand dunes, frozen river trek and snow leopards all find their 
        only home in Ladakh.</p>
